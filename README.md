# ffuf-cmdbuilder
Use python to craft ffuf actions.
it's pretty much a framework to be optimized for your usage.
i dont like remebering all these argument and flags etc
so i made this easy to use program to launch a few basic 
commands.

# TODO 
- document code
- add option to limit requests/per second
- better focus on user interaction and customabliity 
- specify location of wordlists
